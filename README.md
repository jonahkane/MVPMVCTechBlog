This project is a CMS style blog site that is similar to a Wordpress site. Users can publish blog posts and comment on other developer's posts as well. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Squelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
